# Learning to code

## For Exploring Ideas

These projects are either taking what I learned from tutorials and making it my own, trying to use the ideas differently, or just trying things out.

## For Code Along projects

No changes other than comments made to the code in these, I coded along with the course or tutorial

Moved Cat or Dog CNN to it's own folder to include the data set, other coursework from "Machine Learning A-Z for Data Science" by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves remains in Machine Learning coursework folder due to not currently having access to the data sets.


## This is a test
